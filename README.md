# Clue Skin for Kodi

**Clue Skin** package/addon is designed to become the default skin for Kodi over
**Clue 2.0** - Linux OS build and optimized for RPi devices, but might be used also 
as a standalone skin addon for Kodi (v18+ compatible).

Development, testing and deployment activities are driven by CCM process (Clue 
Configuration Management), built over GNU `make` utility. To see all make rules
try `make help`.

_Enjoy!_
